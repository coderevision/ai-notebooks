# CodeRevision AI Notebooks

**CodeRevision** refers to an automated & streamlined process of writing and managing version-controlled code within AI-enabled **Jupyter Notebook** cells.

**CodeRevision** is an open-source project that consists of the following components:

(1) Modular notebook template libraries that contain tagged code segments that can be assembled into scripts and/or programs

(2) Templates include boilerplate code and complete applications (written in **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Python**, and more soon) for introductory demos (**Hello World**, **To Do Lists**) as well as advanced platform & AI/ML engineering tasks

(3) **UCT** (**U**niversal **C**oding **T**emplate) will be a code editing framework & **VS Code** extension powered by **GitHub Copilot** that will provide code generation and debugging for known programming languages with a guide to parse and/or create various scripts and apps.

(4) Automatic versioning of code updates and profile selection to persist relevant settings, extensions, and UI layouts of the projects in use 

(5) List of **GitHub Actions** (with optional **GitHub Codespaces** integration) to perform software lifecycle tasks like setting up development environments; deployments; and curated pipelines for the software code review process, CI/CD, ML training, etc.

(6) Links to **Postman** collections and workflows for **REST** & **GraphQL** APIs

(7) **APIgenApp** process that generates working apps from API requests / responses and SDKs
